# Interactive Map

Base Repository for Mini Project 4: Interactive Map

This code will generate a map of the United States containing data from 1999 to 2016 of the causes of death. The map will have a color gradient dependent on the death density of the state. When the mouse clicks on the marker of a specific state, a text box will appear with the top ten causes of death with the number of deaths in the given year.
